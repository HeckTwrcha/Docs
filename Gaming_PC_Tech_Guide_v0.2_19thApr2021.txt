# (L2) Level-2 cache memory: is a slower but larger capacity to L1, it is a built-in in the processor core for "Rigister" communication (core to core communication).
# (L3) Level-3 cache memory: is a on Socket (physical CPU) slower but larger in capacity than L1&L2 facilitates (CPU to/from RAM) rigister coomunications.   

# (DIMM)       Dual In-line Memory Module.
# (RDIMM)      Registered/Buffered DIMM, 288-pin.
# (UDIMM/DIMM) Unregistered/Unbuffered DIMM, 288-pin.
# (SODIMM)     Small Outline Dual In-line Memory Module, 260-pin.
# (LRDIMM)     load-Reduced DIMM.
# (ECC)        Error Correction Code (Checksum).
# (NECC)       None-ECC memory.
# (CRC)        Cycle Redundancy Check.
# (HKMG)       High-K Metal Gate: DDR5 manufacturing material.
# (MemBIST)    Memory Built-In Self-Test.
# (CL)         CAS Latency: the lower the better. varies between (CL13 to CL19) for current DDR4.
# (UL)         Unloaded Latency: measured in (nano second), UL= (CL/frequency)x 2000, for example: (DDR4-3200MHz CL16-18-18-38, 1.35V), UL= (16/3200)x 2000 = 10ns.
# Memory Ranking  1R, 2R, 4R. 
# (QVL)        Qualified Vendors Lists.
# (POST)       Power-On Self-Test.
# (Benchmark)  Memory burn test.
# (JEDEC)      Joint Electron Device Engineering Council: IC, chips & Industry-standard timings are defined by them. 
# (SPD)        Serial Presence Detect: is a hardware feature that provides the motherboard with the presence memory speed and timing by reading a tiny ROM chip (SPD ROM) on the memory                      module that holds a table of timing (SPD data) supported by the memory module.
# (XMP)        Intelâs âExtreme Memory Profilesâ: is a HW feature supported by the motherboards with (O.C.) capability. it allows the motherboard to chang/modify the SPD data table to                      achive higher memory speed with lower latency. XMP is not recommended nor supported by the memory maufacturer because it is risky and it will voide your warranty and support                 and may distroy your memory & motherboard. 
# FCLK ????
# DOCP ????
# You will need at least two modules to enable a dual-channel mode on platforms such as AMDâs Socket AM4 or Intelâs LGA 1151, or four to enable the quad-channel modes of AMDâs socket          TR4 and Intelâs LGA 2066.
# Single rank (with all ICs addressed by one of each moduleâs dual 64-bit interfaces) or dual-rank (addressed by both interfaces).
# if you are buying a memory module (DIMM) and you want to pick somthing with the best performance, make sure the UL latency is below 10ns, the lower the more expensive. 
  for example a PC4-3200MHz CL16 the speed is 3200MT/s and UL=(16/3200)x2000=10ns there for (CL < 16, UL < 10ns).
# Always buy a single memory kit for your desired capacity. Never combine two memory modules or memory kits even if they're from the same vendor and product line. Mixing and matching          may not always produce a desirable result and sometimes manual tweaking is required to achieve stability.
# SK-Hynix made the first DDR5 5200MHz,5200MT/s chip and announced a 6400MT/s chip later, this is the highest speed within the DDR5 standard.

## In October 2008, AMD announced plans to spin off manufacturing operations in the form of (GlobalFoundries Inc.) (state owned by Abu Dhabi, UAE), a multibillion-dollar joint venture with    (Advanced Technology Investment Co.) owned by (Mubadala Investment Company PJSC), an investment company formed by the government of Abu Dhabi. The partnership and spin-off gave AMD an      infusion of cash and allowed it to focus solely on chip design. To assure the Abu Dhabi investors of the new venture's success, AMD's CEO Hector Ruiz stepped down in July 2008, while      remaining executive chairman, in preparation for becoming chairman of GlobalFoundries in March 2009. President and COO Dirk Meyer became AMD's CEO. Recessionary losses necessitated AMD      cutting 1,100 jobs in 2009.

  # November 12 2019 AMD has wanted out of the fab game for quite some time, but the cross-licensing agreement prevented that. Now AMD is free to sell off its stake of Global Foundries to       Abu Dhabiâs Advanced Technology Investment Company (ATIC), who already owns the other half of GF. The result will be that ATIC will own a foundry like theyâve always wanted, and AMD         will be rid of the task of operating a foundry like theyâve always wanted.
    This in turn is going to have two immediate short-term benefits for AMD. The first of course is more cash; selling their share in ATIC is going to net the company a fair bit of cash and     cash equivalents. The second of which is that AMD had to absorb some of GFâs losses; they would have turned a profit last quarter for example if owning part of GF didnât cause them to     take a $100mil loss. So AMD is going to have more cash on hand, and theyâre going to further resolve their long-standing cash bleed. By no means does this make them rich (they still are     up to their eyes in debt), but this opens up a great deal of liquidity to invest in new processor designs. After all, theyâve gone fabless, R&D is where the bulk of their investments        will be.

## Feb 2021 - AMD has published a new patent in which the company talks about an active chiplet serving as a bridge between multiple GPU dies, possibly based on its next-generation RDNA3       architecture for GPUs and APUs. ##

# (Ray Tracing)  simulating the physical behaviour of light.
# NVIDIA CUDA Cores.  
# GDDR6 VRAM.
# NVIDIA Studio platform of dedicated drivers and exclusive tools, advanced VR rendering.
# NVIDIA new NVLink system (the successor to SLI): enable using up to four GPU cards as one on the same computer.
# The PC required to run a game at 144 frames per second (fps) in 4K, or even at 120fps, will set you back quite the bundle of green too.
  In our testing, we found that at the bare minimum, most gamers will need a PC that uses dual GeForce RTX 2080 graphics cards just to hit 100fps at 4K. To get to 120fps or 144fps, dual     GeForce RTX 2080 Ti cards are what you'll need. In either case, the cards would be linked through Nvidia's new NVLink system.
# Also you need a Monitor or TV that supports (4K HDR 144Hz) with HDMI2.1 or DP interfaces and cable in order to get 144fps at 4k resolution.
